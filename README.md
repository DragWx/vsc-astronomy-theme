# Astronomy
Astronomy is a dark, dichromatic color theme meant for keeping things
straightforward and functional.

Source code starts at neutral white, then shifts either warmer to represent
value, or cooler to represent logic. The stronger the tint, the darker it gets.

Equations stay neutral with minimal variance, so separators like strings and
brackets are the only things that stick out.

There are no bright, vibrant colors; you and your extensions are free to use
them instead.

Also included is a red-green colorblind accessible version of this theme.

## Color Strategy
* Logic-ish things are cooler
* Value-ish things are warmer
* The stronger the color, the darker it gets
* Declarative things tend to be stronger
* Equationy things tend to be neutral

## Tips
* Although *any* font is fine, the font featured in the screenshots is [Iosevka Slab](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka).
* This theme works well with [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2).
