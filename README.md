# Astronomy
Source code starts at neutral white, then shifts warmer/darker or cooler/darker.

Math-heavy equations stay neutral with minimal variance, so separators such as strings and brackets are all that stick out.

Colorful, but without bright, vibrant colors, allowing you and your extensions to use those colors for yourself.

## Color Strategy
* Logic-ish things are cooler
* Value-ish things are warmer
* The stronger the color, the darker it gets
* Declarative things tend to be stronger
* Equationy things tend to be neutral
